# KoopmanGraph
1. The project includes codes generating the simulation results of the submitted paper "Modularized data-driven approximation of the Koopman, Y.Guo, M.Schaller, K. Worthmann, S. Streif".
2.  Matlab is required to run the codes. 
3.  "Coupling_Duffing_final.m" is for the first example in Section 5.2 of the paper.
4.  "Coupling_VanDerPol_final.m" is for the second example in Section 5.2 of the paper.
5. "Coupling_Transferlearning_final.m" is for the section 6 of the paper.
